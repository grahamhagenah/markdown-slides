---
---
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents. It is easy to learn and widely used for creating documents and web pages.

Now you can make **presentations** in markdown. This web application transforms the markup language into simple slide decks to draft, share, or present.

Read on to learn more or start making slides in the markdown editor :‑)

## Creating New Slides

The H1 and H2 tags mark the beginning of new slides. Each heading is denoted by hashtags (#) to establish hierarchy in the document.

Type in the hashtags manually or use the formatting menu to create new headings.

If you make a mistake, there's an undo button too.

## Basic Formatting

You can use basic formatting to make text **bold**, *italic*, or ~~strikethrough~~.

You can create [hyperlinks](https://grahamhagenah.com) by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.

## Making Lists

## Using Controls

Enter a distraction-free *fullscreen* mode by using the toggle below.

Navigate between slides using the left and right arrows, or use the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) on your keyboard.

## Tabular Data

Create a table of varying sizes from the menu above the editor.

## How It's Built

Markdown Slides is built using **React**, a front-end library for creating user-interfaces.

The markdown editor is provided by [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown-editor-lite).
