"Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents. It is easy to learn and widely used for creating documents and web pages.\n\n" +

"Read on to learn more or start making slides in the markdown editor :‑)\n\n" +
"## Creating New Slides\n\n" +
"The H1 and H2 tags mark the beginning of new slides. Each heading is denoted by hashtags (#) to establish hierarchy in the document.\n\n" +
"Type in the hashtags manually or use the formatting menu to create new headings." +
"\n" + "\n" +
"If you make a mistake, there's an undo button too." +
"\n" + "\n" +
"## Basic Formatting" +
"\n" + "\n" +
"You can use basic formatting to make text **bold**, *italic*, or ~~strikethrough~~." +
"\n" + "\n" +
"You can create [hyperlinks](https://grahamhagenah.com) by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses." +
"\n" + "\n" +
"To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph." +
