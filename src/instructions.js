Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents. It is easy to learn and widely used for creating documents and web pages. 

Now you can make **presentations** in markdown. This web application transforms the markup language into simple slide decks to draft, share, or present. 

Make a small change in the *editor panel* to start making slides :â€‘)


## Creating New Slides
The H1 and H2 tags mark the beginning of new slides. Each heading is denoted by hashtags (#) to establish hierarchy in the document.

Type in the hashtags manually or use the formatting menu to create new headings. 

If you make a mistake, there's an undo button too.

## Basic Formatting
You can use basic formatting to make text **bold**, *italic*, or ~~strikethrough~~.

You can create [hyperlinks](https://grahamhagenah.com) by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.


## Making Lists
### Ordered List
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Writing Code 
Display code using plain HTML. Just make sure to indent with four spaces.

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Title here</title>
      </head>

## Using Controls
Enter a distraction-free *fullscreen* mode by using the toggle below. Navigate between slides using the arrows, or use the arrows on your keyboard.


## Tabular Data
Create a table from the menu above the editor.

| Technology | Category | Primary Use | Description |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|
| HTML | Markup Language   | Structuring Websites  | The standard markup language for Web pages
| CSS  | Style Sheet | Styling Websites  | Used for describing the look of Web pages
| JavaScript | Programming Language | Interactive Elements | Enables interactive web pages


## How It's Built
Markdown Slides is built using **React**, a front-end library for creating user-interfaces.

The markdown editor is provided by [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown-editor-lite).
