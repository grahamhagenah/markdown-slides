Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents. It is easy to learn and widely used for creating documents and web pages. 

Now you can make **presentations** in markdown. This web application transforms the markup language into simple slide decks to draft, share, or present. 

Make a small change in the *editor panel* to start making slides :â€‘)


## Creating New Slides
The H1 and H2 tags mark the beginning of new slides. Each heading is denoted by hashtags (#) to establish hierarchy in the document.

Type in the hashtags manually or use the formatting menu to create new headings. 

If you make a mistake, there's an undo button too.

## Basic Formatting
You can use basic formatting to make text **bold**, *italic*, or ~~strikethrough~~.
