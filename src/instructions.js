Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents. It's easy to learn and widely used for creating documents and web pages. 

Now you can make **presentations** in markdown. This web application transforms the markup language into simple slide decks to draft, share, or present. 

Read on to see how it works, or edit this document to try it yourself :â€‘)

## Creating New Slides

The H1 and H2 tags mark the beginning of new slides. Each heading is denoted by hashtags (#) to establish hierarchy in the document.

Type in the hashtags manually or use the formatting menu to create new headings. 

If you make a mistake, there's an undo button too.

## Basic Formatting

You can use basic formatting to make text **bold**, *italic*, or ~~strikethrough~~.

You can create [hyperlinks](https://grahamhagenah.com) by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.

## Making Lists

### Ordered List
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Unordered List
- Item A
- Item B
- Item C

## Writing Code 
Display code using plain HTML. Just make sure to indent with four spaces.

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Title here</title>
      </head>
      
## How It's Built
Markdown Slides is built using **React**, a front-end library for creating user-interfaces.

The markdown editor is provided by [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown-editor-lite).
